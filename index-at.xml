Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad and weak area of low pressure just offshore of the middle <br/>
Texas coast continues to produce some disorganized shower activity <br/>
along portions of the coast of Texas and over the adjacent waters of <br/>
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. This system is expected to meander <br/>
for another day or so, and some slow development is possible if it <br/>
remains offshore.  On Tuesday, the low is forecast to move inland, <br/>
and further development is not expected.  Regardless, heavy rains <br/>
could cause some flash flooding across portions of the Texas coast <br/>
during the next couple of days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Lesser Antilles and Caribbean Sea:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing disorganized thunderstorms and gusty <br/>
winds across portions of the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and over <br/>
the adjacent eastern Caribbean waters.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become more conducive for development when the system <br/>
reaches the western Caribbean Sea and southwestern Gulf of Mexico <br/>
late this week and over the weekend, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form during that time.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic Ocean:<br/>
A tropical wave just offshore of the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to gradually become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression could form in a few days <br/>
while the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.  This system <br/>
could produce areas of heavy rain and gusty winds across portions of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands in a day or two.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
